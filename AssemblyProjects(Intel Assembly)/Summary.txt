These projects are written in x86 Intel Assembly language. To better understand how assembly works.
We were assigned these projects that could be accomplished easily in a higher level language,
but takes more work when creating in assembly.

Projects:
proj1- Prompts user for quantity of numbers to add, the value of those numbers, 
        then stores those values and returns the sum.

proj2- To practice comparing values in assembly. Takes user input and 
        displays number of words of certain sizes.

proj3- Practice creating and calling methods in assembly. Methods are
        stored in proj3methods.
