The ETSU Department of Social Work needs a system to keep track of 
social services in the area (shelters, soup kitchens, financial assistance,etc)
to better help their clients. We were tasked to come up with a way to track these
and allow social workers to look up services that a person need. 

Development Team: Jarred Wininger, Isaac Styles, Jacob Gannt, Ben McFee, Jacob Davenport

Tools: MySQL database, Laravel, PHP

This is the result of 2 months of work. Upon entering the second portion of the
Software Engineering Course, our work was handed off to another group for completion.

We are currently working on a related project which will create a heat map of 
services in the area to show gaps in service as well as highlight areas 
that each service provides for.
